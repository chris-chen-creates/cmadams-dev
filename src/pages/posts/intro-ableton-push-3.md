# I got an Ableton Push 3
So I'd been eyeing the new [Push 3](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) from Ableton since the announcement back in May. I've been using Ableton in combination with the Push 2 (the previous version) since around 2018. I absolutely loved the interface of the Push 2 and the flow of writing music with it. I've also used to perform with a few times and it's perfect for launching loops and improvising on the fly. The only part of it that I wanted to change is **it needed to be connected to a computer running Ableton**. 

The biggest concern that came from the tethering of a laptop was the event that the laptop crashes or runs into an issue like freezing up or getting overwhelmed by too much load. So my biggest wishlist item was a standalone Push that could still run Ableton (or an instance of it). 

## And that's what I got!
When they announced the standalone Push 3, I was HYPEDDD! It sported a new surface that supports MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) which is a fancy way of being able to alter your sounds based on multiple physical parameters such as force of press, X/Y location of where you touch the pad, and how you move your finger while touching the pad. For a really cool example of this, OBLVYN has a really [cool video](https://youtube.com/shorts/VKWvDo683qI?feature=share) of playing with an MPE enabled MIDI keyboard. The new Push also sports some quality of life updates to the buttons, dials, encoders, and screen as well as having a built in audio interface. That's rad because then I can plug my mic and guitar straight into the Push and start playing and recording.

Of course the biggest update is that it now is standalone and can use Ableton with out a computer. **HALLELUJAH!!!** My prayers have been answered! And on top of that, it's upgradeable over time. You'll be able swap out the CPU, RAM, and storage as better parts become available! Definitely a first in the music production world where it's typically - what you see is what you get.

## Initial thoughts
So on first use the setup time was pretty long since you have to get packs of music content downloaded (like digital instruments and samples), but it wasn't too bad. I found that once booted up, it's a pretty snappy experience getting around the folders and interface. I think there is definitely some room for navigational improvements, but overall it's like the Push 2 (which I'm used to). 

Once I got through the downloading, I started playing some of the new MPE instruments and **OH MY** this thing is **SICCCC**! What I love the most is that it *feels* like playing a physical instrument with slight variations whenever you touch it. For hours this morning, I just sat there and played and it was such a wonderful experience!

## Time for the bad :(
Since this is a new type of product that's never been done before, there are some bugs. Not nearly as bad as the Ableton forums have made it out to be (you would think this thing is a paperweight reading the posts on there), but there are still some bugs. It seems the Ableton team is pushing updates quick and have been working through all the tickets coming in. I think it's important to say that the Push is running a custom version of Linux and Ableton has never been available on Linux so I'm sure there's a lot of learning for the dev team as they support this product. Here's a quick list of the bugs I've seen so far:
- Transferring samples from a computer to the Push sometimes just doesn't work and errors out
- Sometimes the Push will disconnect from Ableton desktop with no errors
- Navigating around would sometimes be a bit jumpy
- You can't rename the **Favorites** collections (quick access folders)

That's about all I've found so far which isn't too bad I think.

## Time to go jam!
That's some quick initial thoughts, but I'm gonna stop writing and go **play**! I'll be updating my findings and posting some sound clips of what I make as keep on jamming. 

Till next time friends!
